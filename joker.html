            <div class=intro1>
            <p>For this project, I was asked to mimic a take-home assignment and was given 24 hours to design and code a single-page website for a new movie coming to a nearby theater.</p>

            <p>I wanted to create a website that was simple, yet encompasing. With information on the release date,
              trailer and use of several images, I provided the user with the content they need, without the distractions.
              It's a one-stop destination that will get you in and out and ready to enjoy the movie.</p>

                  <p>When I read the prompt, I first checked to see what movies were coming out to start to get inspired. I thought Joker would be a fun title to choose as it
                    has distinct branding and a lot of available resources (film stills, social media sites, etc).</p>

                    <p>A User Survey and Competitive Analysis was skipped for this project, due to the time constraint and knowing there was already a need in the market. As some informal research,
                      I looked at several websites for other films for inspiration and to discover what information is included or left out. </p>

                    <li class="points">Sue loves to go to the movies. She has an AMC A-List pass, which means she can go to the theater an unlimited amount of times for one monthly price. As such, she’s always looking to see what movies are coming to her nearby theater soon.</li>
                    <li class="points hide2">Jason first heard about this movie over a year ago and has been excited to see it ever since. He’s looking for a site where he can find information on the movie and see trailers to feel like he’s already in the action.</li>
