                    <h3>My Path to UX</h3>
                    <p>I first learned about UX early in 2018. I had decided that I wanted to get into tech as I think it’s important for more women to be in that industry. I’d been selected to receive a free scholarship for a front-end course through Udacity and was so excited to jump in!<p>
                    <p>What I realized, is that I enjoyed all of the aspects of coding that affected the aesthetics of my projects, but was not passionate about coding itself.</p>
                    <p>Through this, I learned about UX and UI design and instantly felt that it was what I needed to do. I researched bootcamps for months and started to self-teach on the side and finally found and enrolled in Bloc.</p>
                    <p>I chose Bloc for it’s thorough curriculum. Not only did it incorporate all of the UI and UX principles, but it also had sections of front-end, which I recognized to be beneficial for my future. Both in order to code things myself, but also to be able to better work with developers in future roles.</p>
                    <p>I’m wrapping up my program now with this shiny new (fully coded by me) website to show off some of my skills.</p>

                  <p>Though design was never in my title, I always sought out ways to bring design and
                    other creativity to my life. Utilizing various mediums both on paper and computer,
                    I’ve always itched for a more creative role.</p>
