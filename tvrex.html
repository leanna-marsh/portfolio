            <p>I wanted to create an app to help users stay organized and up-to-date with their favorite shows.
              Keeping the user in mind, I always focused on keeping screens clean and tasks simple, so you can
              find a title, find your place and go. With recommendations based off of the user's friends and followers
              on top of the app's algorithm, they'll have a good idea of what they'll enjoy without choice fatigue.

                  <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
                  <div class=intro1>
                  <p>I wanted to create a place where all of your shows can live in one spot, whether you're watching it on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Prime.
                  My inspiration came from Goodreads, a platform for books. I took this idea and thought about how it would translate to TV.</p>

                    <h3 class="space">Research</h3>
                    <div class=intro1>
                    <p> was able to survey 48 people to gain insight into their Film/TV watching habits and app wishes/desires.</p>
                    <p><br>Main Takeaways:</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="introlist">
                    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                      <li class="points">There is general interest in this type of app.</li>
                      <li class="points">Though a lot of people are influenced by user reviews, very few users like to leave reviews for what they watch.</li>
                      <li class="points">Most users trust and enjoy the recommendations of streaming sites’ algorithms as well as peer recommendations.</li>
                      <li class="points">IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes were the top film/tv sites used for reviews and information.</li>
                      <li class="points">Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and HBO were the top streaming sites and most users only stream content as opposed to watching live TV or owned content.</li>
                      <li class="points">People mostly rely on streaming sites to keep track of their place for their content, though some keep track of their own in notebooks.</li>

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <div class="intro1">
                    <p>Based on the user surveys, I felt good about my initial idea, but needed to research platforms that currently exist to see if/where there is room in the market for TV Rex.
                    <br><br>I researched Tubi, Decider and TV Time:</p>
                       <!-- add images and maybe links to all three here-->
                     <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                       <li class="results">Hobi is an app that helps you track your progress on shows, but has a small user base.</li>
                       <li class="results">TV Time is a social platform for tracking shows and chatting about them.</li>
                       <li class="results">Decider helps you decide what to watch next, but is only a website without personalization.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p><br>Researching those companies helped me to formulate how to stand out in the market:
                    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                      <li class="results">Target an audience that isn’t looking for another social app like TV Time.</li>
                      <li class="results">User recommendations should be as personalized as possible.</li>
                      <li class="results">Try and find a way to have the streaming apps (Netflix, Hulu, etc) sync to TVRex for easy use.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li class="points">Adam is looking to stay up-to-date with trending titles. He likes to know where he is able to watch a certain show and have organized lists of what he’s watching and what he’s seen. He dislikes rating titles so will only do so if it’s a simple task for him. He also doesn’t like that every app tries to turn into a social app, so he doesn’t want to see a screen of a social feed.</li>
                    <li class="points">Cindy is a professional who loves lists. She’s looking for a platform to stay organized in her free time. She likes to watch shows with her husband, so she’d love to be able to know when he’s seen an episode of their favorite show so that she can watch too. She also doesn’t want a social platform and dislikes suggested content that feels irrelevant.</li>
                    <li class="points hide2">Monica usually watches shows with friends to unwind and often feels overwhelmed with a burden of choice. She would love a place that can tell her what her friends have enjoyed watching as well as receiving recommendations based on shows she has liked.</li>
