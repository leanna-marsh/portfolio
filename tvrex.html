            <h3>The Prompt</h3>
            <p>This was my final solo project for my design course. As such, it was open-ended. We had to come up with our own problem and our own solution.
          </div>
          <hr>

          <h3 class="space">Initial Concept</h3>
          <div class=intro1>
          <p>My inspiration came from watching The Americans with my boyfriend. As we live in separate apartments, we would text each another to see if one of us had watched another episode.
             Wanting to easily know my place in all of my various shows, as well as my boyfriend or friends' places, I decided to create a solution!
          </p>

          <h3 class="space">Research</h3>
          <p>I had to determine if this idea was not limited to just my relationships and to find out if there is a need for this type of app in the market. As such, I started with a survey.
            <br><br>I surveyed 48 people and gained helpful insight.</p>
          <p><br>Main Takeaways:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="introlist">
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li class="points">People liked the idea of an app for their TV shows.</li>
            <li class="points">Very few users like to leave reviews for what they watch.</li>
            <li class="points">Most users trust and enjoy the recommendations of streaming sites’ algorithms and peer recommendations.</li>
            <li class="points">IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes were the top sites used for reviews and information.</li>
            <li class="points">Most users stream content with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and HBO being the top platforms used.</li>
            <li class="points">People mostly rely on those sites to keep track of what episode they're on.</li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <h3 class="space">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>Based on the user surveys, I felt good about my initial idea, but needed to research platforms that currently exist to see if/where there is room in the market for TV Rex.
        <br><br>I researched Tubi, Decider and TV Time:</p>
           <!-- add images and maybe links to all three here-->
           <div class="introlist">
         <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
           <li class="points">Hobi is an app that helps you track your progress on shows, but has a small user base.</li>
           <li class="points">TV Time is a social platform for tracking shows and chatting about them.</li>
           <li class="points">Decider helps you decide what to watch next, but is only a website without personalization.</li>
         </ul>
         <p><br>Researching those companies helped me to formulate how to stand out in the market:
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li class="points">Target an audience that isn’t looking for another social app like TV Time.</li>
          <li class="points">User recommendations should be as personalized as possible.</li>
          <li class="points">Try and find a way to have the streaming apps (Netflix, Hulu, etc) sync to TVRex for easy use.</li>
        </ul>

  <!--    <div class="introlist">
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li class="points">Adam is looking to stay up-to-date with trending titles. He likes to know where he is able to watch a certain show and have organized lists of what he’s watching and what he’s seen. He dislikes rating titles so will only do so if it’s a simple task for him. He also doesn’t like that every app tries to turn into a social app, so he doesn’t want to see a screen of a social feed.</li>
        <li class="points">Cindy is a professional who loves lists. She’s looking for a platform to stay organized in her free time. She likes to watch shows with her husband, so she’d love to be able to know when he’s seen an episode of their favorite show so that she can watch too. She also doesn’t want a social platform and dislikes suggested content that feels irrelevant.</li>
        <li class="points hide2">Monica usually watches shows with friends to unwind and often feels overwhelmed with a burden of choice. She would love a place that can tell her what her friends have enjoyed watching as well as receiving recommendations based on shows she has liked.</li>

                          before creating the wireframes, prototypes and final pieces. Below is one of the user flows I created for TV Rex that shows how a user would
                        add a new title to a watch list (currently watching, want to watch or have watched.)</p>

                        It really leant itself to a playful logo of a T-Rex's silhouette. Below you'll see a lot of different ideas I was thinking of for the logo before deciding on the final version. The color palette came quickly as I knew I wanted
                        this to have a dark theme and wanted to tie in some earthy tones to tie in the T-Rex of TV Rex as well.</p>

                          <li>Fix the location of the icon to indicate you’re watching with someone and maybe make it a small icon of their profile image instead.</li>
                          <li>Change “recommend” to something else - “Do you like this show?” “Do you want to favorite this show?” or “Is this a show you’re enjoying?”</li>
                          <li>Add some clarification to what “recommending a show” would do - improve your recommendation algorithm as well as give your friends ideas as to what to watch.</li>
                          <li>Change one of the star icons, either the IMDB one or the recommendations one.</li>

                          Though two of the tests confirmed my original design, the other two caused changes to my prototype, to better adhere to user's wants.</p>
                          <div class="introlist">
                            <div class="centerit">
                                <img src="images/rexPref1.png" alt="image of a preference test, testing the colors of the top nav bar" class="rexImg">
                            </div>
                            <p>The first preference test was to determine whether or not I should keep the top section of my app (that contains the nav bar and search bar) as two colors, or switch over to one. Not all screens have a search bar, so I had originally designed it with two colors so that every screen would consistently have the same color nav bar.<br>
                            The testers agreed with my original design and liked the two-color nav bar over the one-color to maintain consistency among all screens.</p>

                            </div>

                            <div class="centerit space">
                                <img src="images/rexPref2.png" alt="image of a preference test, testing the wording of recommendations" class="rexImg">
                            </div>
                            <p>For the second test, I wanted to know what wording made the most sense for my rating/favorites. Originally, I had it asking users “Would you recommend this show?” and if they hit “yes,” their friends would know that they’d recommend it and their algorithm of what shows are recommended to them would improve. I wasn’t sure if I should word it this way, or call it their “starred” shows or “favorite” shows.<br>
                            like the first test, the users also agreed with my original design and decided to keep the wording as "recommend a title" as an encompassing way to suggest and get suggestions.</p>

                            <div>
                              <a href="https://app.usabilityhub.com/do/8521f9fed300/9a55" target="_blank" class="below"><button type="button">Preference Test 2</a>
                            </div>

                            <div class="centerit space">
                                <img src="images/rexPref3.png" alt="image of a preference test, testing the progress bar" class="rexImg">
                            </div>
                            <p> My third preference test focused on the main screen of my app. On that main screen, it shows the shows you are watching, along with a progress bar. Originally, I’d designed it to display your progress for the whole series, but during User Testing, realized that it was confusing as to whether it was for the series or the season.<br>
                            <br>This preference test resulted in a change to my design. Users felt it made more sense for the progress bar to represent the season as opposed to the series. As one user put it, it would be especially challenging for a show that is currently airing to have a progress bar for the entire series.</p>

                            <div>
                              <a href="https://app.usabilityhub.com/do/f3f6c825f616/ca7a" target="_blank" class="below"><button type="button">Preference Test 3</a>
                            </div>
                            <div class="centerit space">
                                <img src="images/rexPref4.png" alt="image of a preference test, testing the labeling of the progress bar" class="rexImg">
                            </div>
                            <p>During my prototype testing, one of the participants wasn't sure what the green bar on the main screen representted. As such, I decided to do a fourth preference test to determine the labeling preference.
                            <br><br>As there was confusion as to what the progress bar should represent, it's not a surprise that users wanted it to be labeled. A few added that it didn't need to be as explicit, a simple 5/12 would suffice, which is how I came up with the final version of this view.</p>

                        <h3 class="space">The Solution</h3>
                        <p>I wanted to create an app to help users stay organized and up-to-date with their favorite shows.
                          Keeping the user in mind, I had a large focus on information architecture and broke up information with space on every screen. The whole idea was to keep tasks simple so you can
                          find a title, find your place and go. With recommendations from user's friends and followers
                          on top of the app's algorithm, any user will know what they'll enjoy without choice fatigue.
