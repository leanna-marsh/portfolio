            <h3>The Prompt</h3>
            <p>This was my final solo project for my design course. As such, it was open-ended. We had to come up with our own problem and our own solution.
          </div>
          <hr>

          <h3 class="space">Initial Concept</h3>
          <div class=intro1>
          <p>My inspiration came from watching The Americans with my boyfriend. As we live in separate apartments, we would text each another to see if one of us had watched another episode.
             Wanting to easily know my place in all of my various shows, as well as my boyfriend or friends' places, I decided to create a solution!
          </p>

          <h3 class="space">Research</h3>
          <p>I had to determine if this idea was not limited to just my relationships and to find out if there is a need for this type of app in the market. As such, I started with a survey.
            <br><br>I surveyed 48 people and gained helpful insight.</p>
          <p><br>Main Takeaways:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="introlist">
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li class="points">People liked the idea of an app for their TV shows.</li>
            <li class="points">Very few users like to leave reviews for what they watch.</li>
            <li class="points">Most users trust and enjoy the recommendations of streaming sites’ algorithms and peer recommendations.</li>
            <li class="points">IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes were the top sites used for reviews and information.</li>
            <li class="points">Most users stream content with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu and HBO being the top platforms used.</li>
            <li class="points">People mostly rely on those sites to keep track of what episode they're on.</li>
          </ul>
          <a href="https://forms.gle/6H7MLfb7BCKrpzmB9" target="_blank" class="link1"><button type="button">Survey and Results</a>
        </div>

        <h3 class="space">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>Based on the user surveys, I felt good about my initial idea, but needed to research platforms that currently exist to see if/where there is room in the market for TV Rex.
        <br><br>I researched Tubi, Decider and TV Time:</p>
           <!-- add images and maybe links to all three here-->
           <div class="introlist">
         <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
           <li class="points">Hobi is an app that helps you track your progress on shows, but has a small user base.</li>
           <li class="points">TV Time is a social platform for tracking shows and chatting about them.</li>
           <li class="points">Decider helps you decide what to watch next, but is only a website without personalization.</li>
         </ul>
         <p><br>Researching those companies helped me to formulate how to stand out in the market:
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li class="points">Target an audience that isn’t looking for another social app like TV Time.</li>
          <li class="points">User recommendations should be as personalized as possible.</li>
          <li class="points">Try and find a way to have the streaming apps (Netflix, Hulu, etc) sync to TVRex for easy use.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="intro1">
        <p class="explaination">Based off of the initial survey, I was able to create hypothetical users for the User Personas. Here are the various goals that our users have:</p>

          </div>
  <!--    <div class="introlist">
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li class="points">Adam is looking to stay up-to-date with trending titles. He likes to know where he is able to watch a certain show and have organized lists of what he’s watching and what he’s seen. He dislikes rating titles so will only do so if it’s a simple task for him. He also doesn’t like that every app tries to turn into a social app, so he doesn’t want to see a screen of a social feed.</li>
        <li class="points">Cindy is a professional who loves lists. She’s looking for a platform to stay organized in her free time. She likes to watch shows with her husband, so she’d love to be able to know when he’s seen an episode of their favorite show so that she can watch too. She also doesn’t want a social platform and dislikes suggested content that feels irrelevant.</li>
        <li class="points hide2">Monica usually watches shows with friends to unwind and often feels overwhelmed with a burden of choice. She would love a place that can tell her what her friends have enjoyed watching as well as receiving recommendations based on shows she has liked.</li>

                            <p>For the second test, I wanted to know what wording made the most sense for my rating/favorites.<br>
                              <br>The testers decided to keep the wording as "recommend a title" as an encompassing way to suggest and get suggestions.</p>

                            <p> My third preference test focused on the progress bar on the main screen and what it should represent.<br>
                            <br><br>This preference test resulted in a change to my design. Users felt it made more sense for the progress bar to represent the season as opposed to the series as a whole. As one user put it, "It would be especially challenging for a show that is currently airing to have a progress bar for the entire series."</p>

                        <h3 class="space">The Solution</h3>
                        <p>I wanted to create an app to help users stay organized and up-to-date with their favorite shows.
                          Keeping the user in mind, I had a large focus on information architecture and broke up information with space on every screen. The whole idea was to keep tasks simple so you can
                          find a title, find your place and go. With recommendations from user's friends and followers
                          on top of the app's algorithm, any user will know what they'll enjoy without choice fatigue.
