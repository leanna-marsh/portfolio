            <p>Our mission was to provide a calming space for productivity and play. Combining aspects
               of successful apps, within gather, the user will be able to create content on-the-go, save
                from the web, send, share, chat and organize. The best part? Everyone can use gather in their
                 own way. Whether you want things to be just for you, for friends, everyone or a combination:

                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p class="explaination">After surveying 29 participants, it was clear that people were looking for a social
                       platform with images and videos to explore, while having the flexibility to keep things private, to their own friends or public. </p>
                    <p>Main Takeaways:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="points">From social media platforms, Pinterest, Instagram and Snapchat were the top used</li>
                      <li class="points">People save Favorite Sites, Articles, References and Videos the most on their bookmarks in a browser</li>
                      <li class="points">People mostly posted photos, videos and art to social media platforms</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="explaination">Knowing I would be creating a social sharing platform, I researched three companies that do just that:
                       Pocket, Instapaper and Pinterest. For this, I performed a SWOT analysis.</p>
