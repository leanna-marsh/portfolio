                  <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
                  <div class="intro1">
                  <p>I wanted to figure out a way to create a platform that would have a unique space in the market.
                    My original idea was to come up with a platform like pinterest, but with a focus on articles and text-based content;
                    something that would take the place of the bookmarks bar in a visual way.
                    Based on that concept, I began my research.</p>

                    <h3 class="space">Research</h3>
                    <div class=intro1>
                    <p>I surveyed 29 participants with a survey I created on Google Forms. When looking at the results, it was clear that people were looking for a social
                       platform with images and videos to explore, while having the flexibility to keep things private, sharing only with their own friends or posting publicly.
                     Though some people were interested in having text-based content such as articles, it wasn't high on their priority list and was not the overall consensus.
                     Due to this, I had to rethink my initial idea to incorporate my findings.</p>

                    <div class="intro1">
                    <p>Based on my survey results, I felt I should shift my idea to a social sharing platform, so I researched three companies that do just that:
                       Pocket, Instapaper and Pinterest. For this, I performed a SWOT analysis that produced the following insights:</p>

                      <li class="results">These platforms focus either just on articles or just on photos and videos, neither on both</li>
                      <li class="results">Many platforms that tried to focus on text-based content no longer exist, so the concept may not be as great as I'd imagined</li>

                        <div class="mission">
                          <p>Our mission was to provide a calming space for productivity and play. Combining aspects
                             of successful apps, within gather, the user will be able to create content on-the-go, save
                              from the web, send, share, chat and organize. The best part? Everyone can use gather in their
                               own way. Whether you want things to be just for you, for friends, everyone or a combination:
                                we’ve got you covered.
                          My solution is Gather: a place for both people and content to gather, connect and intertwine.</p>
